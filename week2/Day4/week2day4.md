### Abstraction:

1. **Definition**: 
   - Abstraction is an OOPs concept that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object. It's about representing features without including background details.

2. **Advantages of Abstraction**:
   - **Simplicity**: Abstraction simplifies the view of an object, so you don't need to understand the internal workings to use it.
   - **Reusability**: Abstract classes and interfaces can be reused to implement common methods in multiple subclasses.

3. **Keyword**: The `implements` keyword is used to implement an Interface

4. **Types**:
   - **Interfaces**: Used for full abstraction, they cannot have any implementation.
   - **Abstract Classes**: Provide partial abstraction with some implemented methods.
   - **Concrete Classes**: Regular classes with full implementation.

5. **Java Examples**: 
   - **Interfaces**: `List`, `Set`, `Map` are interfaces providing a standard set of methods to be implemented by concrete collections.
   - **Abstract Classes**: `AbstractList`, `AbstractCollection` provide skeletal implementations that can be used as starting points for creating concrete collections.

6. **Selenium WebDriver Examples**:
   - **Interfaces**: `WebDriver`, `WebElement`, `Alert` are interfaces representing abstract concepts in browser automation.
   - **Abstract Classes**: `By` is an abstract class providing methods to locate elements.
   - **Concrete Classes**: `RemoteWebDriver` is a concrete implementation of the `WebDriver` interface.
